    "In this project we will be analyzing a data set that contains information about posts on the popular site Hacker News. Created by startup incubator Y Combinator, Hacker News is a site where users submit posts which are then upvoted and commented on, similar to Reddit. The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). \n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we will be interested in two types of posts specifically, Ask HN posts where users submit a question and Show HN posts where users share a project, product or something else of interest. The questions we will look to answer are:\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certian time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the answers to these two questions, we will determine what type of post and at what time of day will gain the largest amount of comments.\n",
